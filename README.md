# LookingAbstract
Abstraction in C# an example of an abstract class
Adding an <strong>interface</strong> class in C#
To quote <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_interface.php">w3schools</a>: 
An interface is a completely "abstract class", which can only contain abstract methods and properties (with empty bodies)
Abstract classes on the other hand can have non abstract methods and properties.
